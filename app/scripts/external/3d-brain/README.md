## What is it ?

This is a 3D brain viewer.

It uses the [BrainBrowser](https://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca/) project to render 3D models. Actually, this project is just a web page that calls the BrainBrowser web service.

## Prerequisites

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

Run : `npm install`.

## Run

Open index.html with web-browser.

## Troubleshooting

When accessing the application locally, your web-browser may not allow you the access cross-origin resources. In this case, you can serve the application for example by running (in the app folder) : `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. The application will then be available at something like [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
